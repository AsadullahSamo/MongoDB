- Although MongoDB is Schemaless, but in real-world we need schema 
- Three approaches for Schema are
1. This approach is very rare where Schema of each document is different
[
  {
	name: "iphone"
	price: 12655
  },
  {
	title: "A science fiction story"
	price: 1000
  }
]


2. This is one of 2 most used approach where there is Schema defined but also some additional fields are present
[
  {
	name: "The prisoner of Zelda"
	price: 12655
  },
  {
	name: "7 wonders of the World"
	price: 12655
	author: "John Lake"
  }
]

3. This is one of 2 most used approach where there is same Schema for all documents

[
  {
	name: "The prisoner of Zelda"
	price: 12655
  },
  {
	name: "7 wonders of the World"
	price: 12655
  }
]
